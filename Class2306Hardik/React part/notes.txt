-> Front end library
-> React generates the JS, HTML,CSS code for browser.
-> It is SPA (Single Page Application) like in Gmail we switch between inbox and spams page remains 
   same does'nt reloads but ui changes.


-> Two phases:
    1. Development phase 
    2. Production phase

Development Phase:
-> If project is in dev phase
-> React use Development server.
-> this development server helps in continuosly changing the ui and get generated html,css,js code.

Production Phase
-> If project is released and deployed on server for public.
-> The seprate dev react server is demolished and merged into express backend server.
-> here we pick up the genrated code and simply use it for production env.
