-> It is also solving the same problem which context solves.
-> It is modified version of redux library for react.
->Used for state management

                                  App
                                   |
  Store(State & reducer)----------First (Producer)
                                   |
                                  Second
                                   |

-> store is similar to context
-> store contains the sates
-> to change / manipulate the state we have reducer
-> we can write fuctions in reducer to change the state
-> reducer manipulates the state by dispatching a action function


Store Steps:
- Create store
- use provider in top class to provide store
- Create slice and reducer function
- Now add slice to reducer in store (naming is !important)
